Hi, I'm Alice ðŸ‘‹  :smiley: --- I am a software developer who is passionate about uplifting others and solving problems. I find joy in getting to know people and their stories. I bring with me a diverse background in real estate and a career in recruitment. I enjoy using technologies to create empathetic solutions. I speak 3 languages, however, my love for languages don't start here. Currently, I am immersed in JavaScript and React, and I look forward to getting my hands on Python and Ruby.

## Tech Stack
* Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Frameworks/Libraries: React
* Version Control: GItHub
* Tools: Git, Netlify, VSCode, Slack
* Database: Supabase
* Dev Practices: TDD, Pair/Mob Programming

## How I Work
A great listener who is task-driven and goal-oriented. My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. Checklists are my absolute favorite. :white_check_mark: If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. :grin: 

## My Values
* Beginner's mindset and curiosity
* Shared understanding and consensus
* Carve your own path
* Expression as authentic self
* Trust and safety

## Goal for 2022
Stacking my software development skills in the most modern programming languages and development methods. Mastering all the tools I need to be fluent in full stack development. Learn how to work with the full complexity of larger code bases and build systems in a team environment.
